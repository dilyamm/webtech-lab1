        <h2>Novelist and writer</h2>
        <img src="kafka.jpg" alt="Franz Kafka" width="300">
        <p> Franz Kafka (3 July 1883 – 3 June 1924) was a German-language novelist and writer from Prague. 
            He is widely regarded as a major figure of 20th-century literature. His work fuses elements of realism and the fantastic. 
            It typically features isolated protagonists facing bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers. 
            It has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity. His best known works include 
            the novella The Metamorphosis and novels The Trial and The Castle. The term Kafkaesque has entered English to describe 
            absurd situations like those depicted in his writing. </p>
